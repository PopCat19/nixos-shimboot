# NixOS Shimboot
I like NixOS. I've started this project since no one else released NixOS shimboot until now. This repository took place with flake approach over the existing scripts from [ading2210/shimboot](https://github.com/ading2210/shimboot), which is mostly incompatible to build with a non-FHS distro like NixOS.

Before this repository, I've made a bunch of attempts initially from [nixos-shimboot-legacy](https://github.com/PopCat19/nixos-shimboot-legacy/tree/qemu-method2), which also derived from [shimboot-nixos](https://github.com/PopCat19/shimboot-nixos). 

This repository was initialized from scratch after [nixos-shimboot-legacy](https://github.com/PopCat19/nixos-shimboot-legacy/tree/qemu-method2) due to inherited contributers and commits from [ading2210/shimboot](https://github.com/ading2210/shimboot). Considering the amounts of change that's been made compared to the original repo, I decided to initialize a clean repo to avoid potential misconceptions. I'll keep the original GPLv3 license except for proprietary/unfree chromeos artifacts that's used to shimboot NixOS.

## Why NixOS?
While NixOS isn't the fastest nor the most minimal linux distribution to run on low-end hardware, it can be one of the most stable, up-to-date, and reproducible distros with proper configurations.

NixOS follows differently from the usual Filesystem Hierarchy Standard, where almost everything is configured and stored within `/nix` and `/nix/store` directories, including various Nix and systemd utilities that make NixOS configurations reproducible and usable.

In turn, users who've only used FHS compliant linux distributions (like Debian for example) will need to familiarize configuring Nix configurations to install packages, configure services and eventually build a custom, reproducible NixOS machine configuration. 

> If you're interested, I strongly recommend trying NixOS in a VM first (or try the Nix package manager for your distribution, if you prefer learning Nix first) following: https://nixos.org/download/ \
|\
You may need to look up several online documentations, videos, or even Reddit and optional Large Language Model guidance (better suited if said LLM supports Model Context Protocols like context7) to learn what you'd wish to achieve with Nix/NixOS. Exploring someone else's NixOS configurations can also help reason and understand NixOS via first/second-hand experience.\

## What's shimboot?
A helpful excerpt from [ading2210/shimboot](https://github.com/ading2210/shimboot)'s [README](https://github.com/PopCat19/shimboot-nixos/raw/refs/heads/main/README.md):
> Shimboot is a collection of scripts for patching a Chrome OS RMA shim to serve as a bootloader for a standard Linux distribution. It allows you to boot a full desktop Debian install on a Chromebook, without needing to unenroll it or modify the firmware.
>
> Chrome OS RMA shims are bootable disk images which are designed to run a variety of diagnostic utilities on Chromebooks, and they'll work even if the device is enterprise enrolled. Unfortunately for Google, there exists a security flaw where the root filesystem of the RMA shim is not verified. This lets us replace the rootfs with anything we want, including a full Linux distribution.
>
> Simply replacing the shim's rootfs doesn't work, as it boots in an environment friendly to the RMA shim, not regular Linux distros. To get around this, a separate bootloader is required to transition from the shim environment to the main rootfs. This bootloader then runs pivot_root to enter the rootfs, where it then starts the init system.
>
> Another problem is encountered at this stage: the Chrome OS kernel will complain about systemd's mounts, and the boot process will hang. A simple workaround is to apply a patch to systemd, and then it can be recompiled and hosted at a repo somewhere.
>
> After copying all the firmware from the recovery image and shim to the rootfs, we're able to boot to a mostly working XFCE desktop.
>
> The main advantages of this approach are that you don't need to touch the device's firmware in order to run Linux. Simply rebooting and unplugging the USB drive will return the device to normal, which can be useful if the device is enterprise enrolled. However, since we are stuck with the kernel from the RMA shim, some features such as audio and suspend may not work.

**TLDR: Gnu/Linux on common (enterprise-configured) chromebooks. It runs from a persistent USB, which can run linux distributions like Arch Linux**

## Why vibecode?
- Sunk cost fallacy.
- To explore how the models perform at specified tasks.
- Lackluster experience in programming.

## Why flake?
[nixos-shimboot-legacy](https://github.com/PopCat19/nixos-shimboot-legacy) barely worked to build a bootable NixOS with frankenstein scripts running on hopes and dreams, yet it wasn't functional enough to even get past LightDM. 

I've also considered using a minimal liveiso image under qemu environment to create a working ROOTFS that most likely has a working user environment came alight. It'd painful and inefficient.

I resorted back to [nixos-generators](https://github.com/nix-community/nixos-generators), but this time using nix flakes with `raw-efi` image config. In the end, it made configurations more reliable.

## Progress and obstacles
Flake status and roadmap (not a spec) for the current branch:
- [x] Builds without flake errors
- [x] Builds current NixOS configuration via [`nixos-generators`](https://github.com/nix-community/nixos-generators)
- [x] Patches RMA shim's `initramfs` with shimboot bootloader and partitions into p2
- [x] Partitions in ChromeOS format
- [x] Builds bootable shim bootloader
- [x] Builds bootable NixOS
- [x] Builds bootable NixOS with running `kill-frecon` service (allowing graphics within shim)
- [x] Builds functional NixOS with running greeter (LightDM)
- [x] Builds functional NixOS with running user environment
- [x] Builds functional NixOS with running hyprland
- [x] Have functional networking
- [x] `nix-shell -p firefox` works (note limited space without `expand_rootfs`)
- [x] Builds functional NixOS with `nixos-rebuild` support (requires appending `--option sandbox false` on shim kernels below 5.6 due to missing kernel namespaces)
- [x] Setup minimal base_configuration
- [x] Setup initial main_configuration for hyprland and home-manager
- [x] Implement multi-board compatibility in flake and build derivations (untested)
- [x] Configure base_configuration to have zram
- [x] Resolve firewall issues at boot
- [x] Configure local cloned repo to have origin remote to sync from during assembly
- [x] Configure base_configuration to be minimal whilst keeping lightdm and hyprland to achive lower image size
- [x] Utilize systemd cachix store on local `nixos-rebuild` to avoid an eternal compilation on potato hardware (hardware r/w speed bottleneck)
- [x] Functional GitHub build CI workflows with caching
- [ ] SDDM greeter support
- [ ] Apply proper recovery firmware patches on a vendor p4 partition to support ChromeOS ROOT_A/B boot; see upstream shimboot for reference
- [ ] Utilize `nixosModules` to modularize various userland options, such as themes and WM/DE.
- [ ] Refine main_configuration [primarily to fixup qt/gtk theme configurations, bwrap/steam, and rewrite nixos_setup for better experience]
- [ ] Create main_configuration template for those who wish to port their own NixOS/HM configurations :3
- [ ] Refine and cleanup scripts and helpers
- [ ] Refine and cleanup base and main configurations
- [ ] Attempt to implement NixOS generation selector within bootstrapper (if possible)
- [ ] Build functional NixOS with LUKS2 support (never done this in my life ;-;)

Current obstacles:
- ChromeOS ROOT_A/B boot: vendor p4 fails to copy donor modules and firmware to tmpfs, causing ChromeOS init to fail. Need to understand how upstream shimboot handled this.
- SDDM greeter support: previous attempts resulted in a blank backlit screen after kill-frecon. Need to evaluate logs and understand how SDDM can be supported declaratively.
- bwrap/steam: NixOS doesn't follow FHS, but mainly stems from shim kernel limitations. Need to understand how and if this can be patched declaratively, or with helper scripts.

## Binary cache

This project has a Cachix binary cache for the patched systemd and nixos-shimboot closures:

- Substituter: https://shimboot-systemd-nixos.cachix.org
- Trusted public key: `shimboot-systemd-nixos.cachix.org-1:vCWmEtJq7hA2UOLN0s3njnGs9/EuX06kD7qOJMo2kAA=`

If you wish to use this cache in your own configuration, add:
```nix
  nix.settings.substituters = [ "https://shimboot-systemd-nixos.cachix.org" ];
  nix.settings.trusted-public-keys = [ "shimboot-systemd-nixos.cachix.org-1:vCWmEtJq7hA2UOLN0s3njnGs9/EuX06kD7qOJMo2kAA=" ];
```
