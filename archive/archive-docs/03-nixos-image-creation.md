# Phase 3: NixOS Image Creation

## Overview

The third phase of the old build process involved creating a base NixOS raw disk image using the `nixos-generate` command. This phase was critical as it provided the foundation for the final shimboot image, containing the NixOS system with all its packages and configurations.

## NixOS Image Generation Process

### Command Execution

The build process used the `nixos-generate` command to create a raw disk image:

```bash
print_info "Building NixOS raw disk image..."
print_info "  This may take 10-30 minutes on first run as it downloads and builds all packages..."
print_info "  Building with verbose output to show progress..."

print_debug "Running: nixos-generate -f raw -c ./configuration.nix --system x86_64-linux --show-trace"
```

**Key Parameters**:
- `-f raw`: Specifies the output format as a raw disk image
- `-c ./configuration.nix`: Uses the local NixOS configuration file
- `--system x86_64-linux`: Targets the x86_64 Linux architecture
- `--show-trace`: Enables verbose output with detailed trace information

### Image Path Extraction

After the NixOS image generation completed, the script extracted the image path from the output:

```bash
# Extract the NixOS image path from the output
local nixos_image_path
nixos_image_path=$(nixos-generate -f raw -c ./configuration.nix --system x86_64-linux --show-trace | grep -o "/nix/store/[^[:space:]]*-nixos-disk-image/nixos.img")

if [ -z "$nixos_image_path" ]; then
    print_error "Failed to extract NixOS image path from nixos-generate output"
    print_error "Check the output above for error messages"
    cleanup_all
    exit 1
fi

print_info "NixOS raw image generated at $nixos_image_path"
print_debug "Image size: $(ls -lh "$nixos_image_path")"
```

**Technical Details**:
- The script used `grep` with a pattern to extract the Nix store path from the command output
- The path followed the pattern `/nix/store/[hash]-nixos-disk-image/nixos.img`
- If the path couldn't be extracted, the script would exit with an error

### Image Characteristics

Based on the build log, the generated NixOS images had the following characteristics:

1. **Variable Sizes**: The image sizes varied between builds:
   - Some builds created 11GB images (e.g., `/nix/store/ms1bhlgsljlhr9qviyypsjkad47lyiwd-nixos-disk-image/nixos.img`)
   - Later builds created 8.6GB images (e.g., `/nix/store/jz20jb9n806x3h00yn7g0c13m8rjqm2z-nixos-disk-image/nixos.img`)
   - The size variation was likely due to different configurations or package sets

2. **Nix Store Paths**: Each build had a unique hash in the Nix store path:
   - Example: `/nix/store/ms1bhlgsljlhr9qviyypsjkad47lyiwd-nixos-disk-image/nixos.img`
   - The hash is determined by the exact inputs and configuration

3. **Ownership**: The images were owned by root:
   - `-r--r--r-- 1 root root 11G Dec 31  1969 /nix/store/.../nixos.img`

## Build Process Observations

### Success and Failure Patterns

The build log shows multiple attempts with varying success:

1. **Successful Builds**:
   ```
   >> NixOS raw image generated at /nix/store/ms1bhlgsljlhr9qviyypsjkad47lyiwd-nixos-disk-image/nixos.img
      Image size: -r--r--r-- 1 root root 11G Dec 31  1969 /nix/store/ms1bhlgsljlhr9qviyypsjkad47lyiwd-nixos-disk-image/nixos.img
   ```

2. **Failed Builds**:
   ```
   !! Failed to extract NixOS image path from nixos-generate output
   !! Check the output above for error messages
   ```

**Key Observations**:
- The build process was not always reliable, with multiple failures
- When it failed, it was typically at the path extraction stage, not the actual image generation
- The script would continue to retry until successful

### Performance Characteristics

From the build log, we can observe:

1. **Build Time**: The build process was time-consuming:
   - The script warned it "may take 10-30 minutes on first run"
   - This was due to downloading and building all Nix packages

2. **Resource Usage**: The process required significant system resources:
   - Disk space for the Nix store and generated images
   - CPU and memory for package compilation
   - Network bandwidth for downloading dependencies

## Configuration File

The build process used a `configuration.nix` file to define the NixOS system:

```bash
nixos-generate -f raw -c ./configuration.nix --system x86_64-linux --show-trace
```

**Key Notes**:
- The configuration file defined the system packages, services, and settings
- It was not included in the archive, so its exact contents are unknown
- The configuration likely included:
  - System packages and services
  - Hardware configuration
  - User accounts
  - Network settings
  - Bootloader configuration

## Error Handling

The script included error handling for the NixOS image generation:

```bash
if [ -z "$nixos_image_path" ]; then
    print_error "Failed to extract NixOS image path from nixos-generate output"
    print_error "Check the output above for error messages"
    cleanup_all
    exit 1
fi
```

**Error Handling Strategy**:
1. Check if the image path was successfully extracted
2. If not, display an error message
3. Clean up resources
4. Exit with a non-zero status code

## Integration with Build Process

The NixOS image creation was the first major step in the build process:

1. **Prerequisites Check**: Verify all required tools and files are available
2. **NixOS Image Creation**: Generate the base NixOS raw disk image
3. **Component Harvesting**: Extract components from ChromeOS images
4. **Image Assembly**: Combine NixOS image with ChromeOS components

## Critical Considerations

1. **Configuration Dependency**: The quality and completeness of the NixOS image depended heavily on the `configuration.nix` file.

2. **Resource Requirements**: The process required significant disk space for the Nix store, which could grow very large over time.

3. **Network Dependency**: The first run required internet access to download packages and dependencies.

4. **Build Reliability**: The build process was not always reliable, with occasional failures in path extraction.

5. **Time Consumption**: The build process was time-consuming, especially on first runs or with complex configurations.

6. **Cleanup**: The Nix store would accumulate old builds over time, potentially consuming significant disk space.

7. **Image Size Variation**: The final image size varied between builds, which could impact the partitioning strategy in later phases.

This phase was foundational to the entire build process, as it created the base NixOS system that would later be combined with ChromeOS components to create the final shimboot image.
